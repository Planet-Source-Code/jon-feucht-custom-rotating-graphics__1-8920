### Description

Allows the user to create shapes supported by a programming script, which are easy to rotate and zoom into. In the screen shot, you will see one such shape and it's formula. In this screen shot, I chose to display a boring graphic, and if you download this, you will see that surely great projects could be made with this code. I have programmed shapes for arrows, and gauges, airplanes, and a nuclear missile with the name "USA" on top. And they are all non-flicker graphics, easily rotated, and extremely quick.
 
### More Info
 
No API calls!!! Just concentrated mathematics!

A readme file will describe some ways in how to use this control. I have tried hard to install form into the control, so that it would be easy to read and that a user not familiar with the code may see the coments and know exactly what is going on.
